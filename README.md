This project is built on the idea of a music genre classifier that uses machine learning and the GTZAN genre dataset to predict the genre and confidence level of Western music.  Pop, Hip-Hop, Rock, Jazz, Blues, Country, and Metal,etc are included in the GTZAN genre dataset.

Algorithm Used 


K-Nearest Neighbours, a machine learning method, is used in this classification of musical genres. This algorithm predicts data points based on how similar they are, or how far apart they are from one another.
